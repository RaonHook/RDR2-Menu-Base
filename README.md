Simple menu base created for anyone who wants to learn to code in C++ and/or wants to mod RDR2 themselves.

Menu_Constructor.h has all the functions that draw/handle the menu
be sure to add your submenus to Submenus enum in enums.h

.asi builds to project directory, though I suggest changing build directory to Red Dead Redemption 2 directory for easier building/testing
Project -> Properties - > Configuration Properties -> General -> Output Directory

Any questions message me on Discord - Raon Hook#1220

(p.s menu base written, designed and tested In about an hour by myself because someone asked In discord, so don't judge too hard :P)
